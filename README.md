# XinaBox SW01 MakeCode extension

This library provides functions to access environmental data from the [XinaBox SW01](https://xinabox.cc/products/sw01).

![](sw01.jpg)

The SW01 uses a Bosch BME280 to report:
* temperature 
* humidity 
* atmospheric pressure.

This library provides functions that give you access to these variables, as well some measures that can be derived from them:
* dewpoint
* altitude

There are 3 other functions:
* power on
* power off 
* set I2C address

## ~ hint

By default the SW01 power is ON, and the I2C address is set correctly (to 0x76).
You do NOT need to power on the SW01 or set the I2C address to use it

## How-to guides:

A comprehensive set of How-to guides that show you how to use the blocks is available online:

## Core functions: Temperature:

```blocks
// Show the temperature in Celcius on the micro:bit 5x5 LED matrix:
basic.showNumber(SW01.temperature(BME280_T.T_C))

// Show the temperature in Celcius on the micro:bit 5x5 LED matrix:
basic.showNumber(SW01.temperature(BME280_T.T_F))

```


## Core functions: Humidity:

```blocks
// Show the relative humidity (as a percentage) on the micro:bit 5x5 LED matrix:
basic.showNumber(SW01.humidity())

```

## Core functions: Atmospheric pressure:

```blocks
// Show the atmospheric pressure in Pascal on the micro:bit 5x5 LED matrix:
basic.showNumber(SW01.pressure(BME280_P.Pa))

// Show the atmospheric pressure in HectoPascals (Pascals / 100) on the micro:bit 5x5 LED matrix:
basic.showNumber(SW01.pressure(BME280_P.hPa))

```
